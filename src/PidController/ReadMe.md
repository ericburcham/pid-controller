A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a control loop feedback mechanism that continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively) which give the controller its name. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the control output.

To use the PID controller, you would create an instance of the PIDController class, passing in the proportional, integral, and derivative constants as arguments to the constructor. Then, you would call the Update method at regular intervals, passing in the setpoint, the current process variable, and the time step (dt) as arguments. The Update method will return the control output, which you can use to adjust the process variable in some way (e.g. by applying a correction to the process).
